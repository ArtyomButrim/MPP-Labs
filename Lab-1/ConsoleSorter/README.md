# Lab1

## Task:

Develop a program that sorts a very large text file (assume that the data from the file does not fit into RAM). The program must be made in two versions: with console and graphical user interface. The sorting procedure must be in a separate assembly.

### Should pay attention to:

1. Sorting must work with Unicode/MBCS/UTF-16 text types.
2. A generator for corresponding text files must be written separately. 
3. Demonstration should be done on a file of at least 1 Gb (expected sorting time is 5-10 min. When splitting it into at least 10 parts).
